# Analysing-Airflight-data
In this project, I will be looking at airline flight data, which contains information on airlines, airports, and routes between airports. Each route represents a repeated flight that an airline flies between a source and a destination airport.

# How to access the data
All of the data is in a SQLite database called flights.db which can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2wax843eniq12g/flights.db?dl=0

# Breakdown of what the data contains
Flights.db contains three tables : airports, airlines, and routes. 

# How to view the data

Simply go to files, click on Airline flights.ipynb file and it will load all the analysed data
